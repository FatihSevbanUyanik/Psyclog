# Psyclog
Psyclog is an application that is designed for people with mental problems. It is
planned to offer a safe environment for people with issues who are afraid or ashamed of
going to therapy with the aim of resolving these issues.There is a significant number of
people who are timid about the idea of going to therapy because of the fear of being made
fun of and the prejudice they might face. Psyclog completely eliminates these fears by
providing a remote system that is usable anywhere as long as the user carries their Android
device with them. If you would like to get a deeper understanding of the implementation, please check the reports.
